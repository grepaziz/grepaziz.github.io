## Rules

I try to follow these rules:

## Time-blocks

* **Session (50/10):** I typically work/study for 50 minutes where I work on one thing for the entire time. There isn't anything important in life besides this one thing. If life interrupt me, I will try to stop the interuption and try to get back to my zone at soon as possible. After the completion of the 50 minutes, I will take a break for 10 minutes where I will be standing and walking the majority of the time. I usually do life tasks (e.g. washing dishes, making coffee, throw trashes, etc.) then I will check my phone for messages real quick without checking any of my socials.
* **Block (6/1):** Every block has 6 sessions and 1 long break. For the sessions, I can have combine two sessions if I am excited in continue what I work on and I feel that I am close by of completion and I know for sure that I have some gas to continue the same quality of work if I took break.

## Typical day

* **5:00-6:00am:** Morning Routine
* **6:00-12:00pm:** Deep Work 1
* **12:00-1:00pm:** Lunch (break)
* **1:00-7:00pm:** Deep Work 2
* **7:00-9:00pm:** Night Routine
