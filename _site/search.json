There isn't anything important in life besides this one thing. If life interrupt me, I will try to stop the interuption and try to get back to my zone at soon as possible. After the completion of the 50 minutes, I will take a break for 10 minutes where I will be standing and walking the majority of the time. I usually do life tasks (e.g. washing dishes, making coffee, throw trashes, etc.) then I will check my phone for messages real quick without checking any of my socials.\n  Block (6/1): Every block has 6 sessions and 1 long break. For the sessions, I can have combine two sessions if I am excited in continue what I work on and I feel that I am close by of completion and I know for sure that I have some gas to continue the same quality of work if I took break.\n\n\nTypical day\n\n\n  5:00-6:00am: Morning Routine\n  6:00-12:00pm: Deep Work 1\n  12:00-1:00pm: Lunch (break)\n  1:00-7:00pm: Deep Work 2\n  7:00-9:00pm: Night Routine"
