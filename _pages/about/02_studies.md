## Studies

### 2020 -2021

Abdulaziz admire mathematics so he Tooks Many Courses in the field of Artificial intelligence to apply math that he loves, he took some supervised, unspervised, and deep learning algorithms, then he made projects in every type of learning, you can check them [here](https://github.com/grepaziz).

Abdulaziz is Foucsing on trying as many Computer science fields as possible before joining college, especially fields that envolves math and physics, that's why he jumped into 25-week long [Quanutm Computing course](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/programs) at October-2020, and he finished the course in May-2020.

now, after he tried some fields in computer science, he decided to learn more about Machine Learning, so he gonna start to build deep understanding in the Mathematics of Machine Learning(Calculus, linear algerba, and Prob&Stats). 


Abdulaziz's plan in this summer is (1) revisiting the pre-calculus, so he can learn the Mathematics of Machine Learning Easily, (2) he's trying to complete the Quantum Computing Notes, which he will publish later on, (3) he also want to take [Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
