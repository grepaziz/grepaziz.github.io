## Notes
- Index and MOCs (Mapping of Content) is the IMF method
- This method is similar to [[associative ontologies]], but MOCs is different
	- MOCs allow to have multiple notes to be linked together based on an intuition order rather than racing for position to describe the note
	- MOCs are like TOC (Table of Content)
- Example of MOCs (by me)

- MOCs cycles:
	- Connecting related stuff
	- Battling it out by forming new ideas, splitting others, and filling gaps
	- Forming a mature spatial map of ideas
- MOCs vs. Ontologies:
	- Ontologies represent what is real, maps are an interpretation of what is real.
	- On a given topic, there should be one ontology, but there can be limitless maps.
	- Maps of content float above the note collection, offering an augmented and customized, but non-destructive perspective
	- While we will also read our maps, at the heart of the process, we are the cartographers.
- MOCs uses TOCs for a specific, linear, and final sequence
	- Examples:
		- when writing a final project like an essay or research paper
		- possibly to arrange notes from a lecture
	- MOCs are [[Evergreen Notes]], just at the next level of emergence
- Fluid Frameworks
	- MOCs and any variation of note consisting mostly links
	- tags
	- Transclusion-heavy notes
		- 
	- Direct Links
- Naming convention
	- MOCs = "related-note" MOC
	- TOCs = "topic" TOC
- Linking Your Thinking (LYT) is the new naming for IMF
