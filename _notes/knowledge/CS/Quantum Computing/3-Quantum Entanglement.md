# Quantum Entanglement
Quantum Correlation between q object where the quantum state of an object will depend on another regardless of how far apart they are, and vice versa.\

Entangled State: $\left|ψ\right> = \sqrt{0.5}\left|00\right> + \sqrt{0.5}\left|11\right>$

if we measure $\left|ψ\right>$
* we get $\left|00\right>$ with 50% Probability
* we get $\left|11\right>$ with 50% Probability

#####  But what if i measure qubit A only 
* if qubit A is 0 $\rightarrow$ then quantum state of qubit B is immediately set to $\left|0\right>$
* if qubit A is 1 $\rightarrow$ then quantum state of qubit B is immediately set to $\left|1\right>$
Regardless of how apart the are even if they far light years away!


# Application of Entanglement
* Quantum Teleportation
 Transferring information or matter from one point to another without physically moving things!
* Quantum Cryptography
* Superdense Coding
* Quantum Speedups
