# Superposition 

^5ddcd3

Superposition is the property of quantum object where the can be in two states in the same time(the cat is dead and alive )
and it is one of the most important property of Quantum Computing which will enhance the computing task


# Superposition on Bits

a bit can be $\left|0\right>$ and $\left|1\right>$ at the same time!
<br>
this is how it we show it: $\left|ψ\right> = α\left|0\right> + β\left|1\right>$
where:
α is the probability of being in the 0 state.
β is the probability of being in the 1 state.

## measurment
qubit: $\left|ψ\right> = α\left|0\right> + β\left|1\right>$
measurment collapses the quantum state of the qubit |ψ> to either |0> or |1>
the prob of measuring |0> : $|α|^{2}$
the prob of measuring |1> : $|β|^{2}$
and $|α|^{2} + |β|^{2} = 1$
Example
* 50-50 superposition of 0 and 1: $\left|ψ\right> = \sqrt{0.5}\left|0\right> + \sqrt{0.5}\left|1\right>$
 $P(\left|0\right>) = |α|^{2} = |0.5|^{2} = 0.5$
 $P(\left|1\right>) = |β|^{2} = |0.5|^{2} = 0.5$
* 90-10 superposition of 0 and 1: $\left|ψ\right> = \sqrt{0.9}\left|0\right> + \sqrt{0.1}\left|1\right>$
 $P(\left|0\right>) = |α|^{2} = |0.9|^{2} = 0.9$
 $P(\left|1\right>) = |β|^{2} = |0.1|^{2} = 0.1$
