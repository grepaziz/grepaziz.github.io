## Notes
- The best way to do get your dream job is to start doing it
- Your goal should be to apply to jobs with a portfolio not a CV
	- However, a portfolio is much harder to beef up than a CV because you need to actually produce lots of visible work.
- Optimizing for an amazing CV has a tremendous amount of luck involved, optimizing for a portfolio is entirely within your control â€” you just need to spend a few minutes everyday.
